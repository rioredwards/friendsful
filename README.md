Use [this template](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/web-template-supabase) for this deliverable.

**Build something with supabase realtime in a group**

## Groups

Work in groups of 2-3 for this assignment.

-   This means one code base (supabase and githubrepo)
    -   one person creates and then gives permissions to the other people
-   You can divvy up features, and/or pair or mob
-   When pairing or mobbing, you **must** switch "drivers" (person writing code) at regular intervals (25 or 30 minutes). Google "pomodoro" for online web timers
-   The "navigator" (person not writing code) typically leads
-   Consciously allow each other to:
    -   Speak
    -   Ideate
    -   Lead
